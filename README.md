Upload your project and allow CAD Professionals to bid, ask questions and get your project finished!

## User Experience/ User Stories

The site has been given a consistent look and feel throughout to make the user experience as good as possible. Professional fonts and colours have been used in keeping with the professional nature of the site.

### Example uses of site

The basic user stories were drawn up prior to development of this site and can be viewed in the wireframes folder.

#### User wants to create an account

On the home and about page there are reasons given as to why a user would want to become a member of the site and sold the benefits of doing so. To register a user would click the 'register' button in the navigation bar, or selected other places around the site. Once signed up they are able to log in, and have access to their personal profile page. From here a user can upload a job, find jobs and upload blogs. The user is advised to set up their personal profile and fill in details to enable them to introduce themselves to other members. The user is able to update this at any time through by clicking the 'edit profile' button.

#### Uploading a job

A user wants to upload a job and find a CAD professional to undertake their work for a new house extension. The user would need to register and sign in as described above. From here they would select the 'create a job' button. This takes them to the 'create a job' page. This page contains a form from which they upload details and images. When a job is created it is placed on the job board from where CAD professionals are able to view and bid on it. 

If the job owner would like to know more about the users who are bidding on their job they are able to click on their 'username', which takes them to a details page about that user. Once happy with a bid, they can press the 'accept bid' button. This job is then only available for view by the job owner and winning bidders boards under 'Active Jobs' in both the job owner and the CAD Professionals profile pages. They should then wait to receive the documents from the winning bidder when they have completed the work and then make the payment.

#### Bidding on a job

As previous, to be able to bid on a job you must first create an account. When logged in you would then go to the 'view jobs' page where you see all jobs uploaded by fellow users. Selecting one of these jobs takes you to that particular jobs detail page, from where you can view more details and images. If you would like to bid on a job you would press the 'make a bid' button. This brings up a page that contains a text box that expects a currency value and a 'confirm bid' button. Once pressed this then appears in your personal page under 'jobs you have currently bid on'. If successful (the job owner selects the 'accept bid' button) the job then appears in the 'jobs under way' board of the users personal page.

#### User want to read or upload blogs

The blog section is created to allow users to understand more about the industry or to share their insights with others. To view blogs, you do not need to be logged in. On the home page you can directly and read the three most recently uploaded blogs, or click the 'view more' button, which redirects the user to the 'blogs page'. Once here they are able to select any of them and read the whole article. If a user would like to upload a blog they would either need to log in, and navigate to the create a blog section from their personal page. If the user who created the blog is logged in and select a blog they have uploaded they would get to either update/edit or delete the post.

#### Shop/Products

A user can go to the shop/products page of the website if they are starting out in the industry and find a selection of related products. If a user wishes to buy a product they can click on the 'add to basket button'. This adds the products to the cart. The user does not need to be logged in or have an account to be able to purchase the products. 

The items in the shop can only be added by superusers of the site through the admin panel, as CADWork is not a site for users to seel their own products.

## Features

Features are functionality that has been added to different areas of the site.

### Jobs

The jobs section (uploading and bidding) contains functionality that enables the users to be able to view the position of a job at any time. The pressing of the buttons moves the job between, being able to bid, active job and completed job. The job owner and the chosen bidder are able to share files between each other on the 'job page'. 

### Blog

The blog contains the functionality to be able to upload, update and delete the post. This, as previously mentioned is only available to those users who are logged in.

### Shop/Products

As with most products/shops online, the products section gives the users the ability to view products, add to their shopping cart and pay for products.

### Payment systems

There are payment features on the site for the shop, and the ability for two users to be able to pay each other.

## Technology Used

This project was built using different languages, libraries and frameworks. 

### Frontend

The template pages have been written with HTML5 (http://www.html5.com/) and styled with CSS3 (www.css3.com) in the style.css file which is held within the staic folder. CSS3 was used to create the mobile responsiveness seen across the whole site. It has also been used to create the hover effects for the buttons and icons. On each of the pages, you will find the jinja template engine used. A 'base.html' page has been created to contain the HTML code that is to be used on each of the pages i.e. the head, header and the footer.

The Bootstrap library has been used to style portions of the site, including the forms, buttons and modals.

jQuery (https://jquery.com/) has been used in the navbar to control the dropdown menus. Javascrpt has been used on the home page for the scrolling image at the top of the page (https://www.javascript.com/). DC and DÂ£ charting libraries are used within a users personal page to show how many jobs they have completed and how many jobs they have currently bidded on and won.

### Python

The site has been built using the Python based Django framework (https://www.djangoproject.com/) and is run from the 'manage.py' file which is stored in the outer folder. Within the main folder you can see the list of apps that have been created to deal with the different functionality of the site. These are:

* Home App - This deals with the home page, about page and the contact form.
* Jobs App - Deals with the uploading of a job for a job owner, the bidding on a job, accepting bids and the messages and payment between the parties.
* Users App - This deals with the sign up, login and reset password functionality.
* Blog App - This deals with the create, edit, delete and the viewing of the blogs
* Shop App - This deals with the viewing of the products/ shop.
* cadwork is the main app file which contains the settings for the site. 

The 'jinja template engine' (http://jinja.pocoo.org/) has been used within the html template pages already described.

### Payment Methods

The products from the shop, if added to the users cart can be paid for through the 'Stripe API'. This is connected to the site with the 'stripe.js' file stored in the 'js' folder within 'static'.

### Data Storage

Database tables were created in the 'models.py' files of the apps.

### Version Control

Git was used throughout the project for version control.

## Testing

### Manual Testing

I have tested the site on different internet browsers (including Chrome, Firefox and Edge). Using the developer tools in Chrome I tested for different screen sizes, to ensure the site is fully responsive and responds to the different screen breakpoints I set in the CSS file.

The CSS was run through a CSS validator and showed no errors. The javascript/jquery code was validated using jshint and showed no errors.

The site has been tested manually by clicking all anchor links to the pages (both internal and external links) and checking all of the jQuery options, including the drop down item for the navbar, the scrolling images on the home page.

Test payments were made using the default test credit card number with Stripe. 

Accounts have been created by myself and others and jobs and blogs were created and bids made. 

### Unit Testing for Python Files

A testing folder was created from where I ran unit tests on the different apps within the project. Different python files were created to test all the models, views and urls files...........

## Further Considerations

### Blog

I would add a comments section to the blog allowing other members to add their thoughts. The logic would be handled in a similar manor to the The users would need to be logged in to access this functionality. Using the same methods as with the navbar and using is_authenticated. If the user is authenticated then a button would be placed at the bottom of the blog. To press this would bring up a textbox, which would be contained within a form. When this was submitted the message would appear at the bottom of the blog.

## Deployment

This project has been deployed to both Github and Heroku by using the push command in the terminal.
